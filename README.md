# Server Side Includes with Cloudflare Workers

Read the blog post: [Server-Side Includes with Cloudflare Workers](https://ssi.artps.org/)

## TL;DR

This repository demonstrates how to use Cloudflare Workers’ HTMLRewriter API to bring back server-side includes (SSI) for simple, fast, and maintainable websites. By leveraging Workers, you can dynamically insert reusable components – like headers, footers, and menus – without relying on traditional CMSs or modern JavaScript frameworks. This approach simplifies web development, reduces complexity, and keeps the focus on delivering content.

## Features

- **Component-Based HTML**: Reuse common elements across multiple pages.
- **Dynamic Includes**: Insert headers, footers, and menus on the fly.
- **No Build Step**: No Webpack, no static site generators – only plain HTML and a bit of server-side processing.

## Why SSI?

This project aims to show that modern web development doesn’t have to mean endless build tools, complex pipelines, or heavy JavaScript frameworks. By revisiting the simplicity of SSI, now powered by the flexibility of Cloudflare Workers, you can:

- Quickly build pages with reusable components using plain HTML.
- Reduce overhead in your stack.
- Deliver a fast, maintainable, and scalable website without relying on traditional CMSs or modern JS frameworks.
